# WeCare Virtual HealthCare Assistant

## The Source of Inspiration:
With new gigantic buildings and skyscrapers emerging every other day and robbing the natural world of its authentic bliss, what has taken the backseat is our primary mental and physical wellness. We are lost in the vortex of our hectic life schedules to such a deep and fatal extent that our health is left gasping for breath. Keeping the demonic exacerbating health issues in the limelight, our project takes immense pride in flaunting and living by the saying:  

#### “GOOD HEALTH IS A CROWN ON THE HEAD OF A WELL PERSON THAT ONLY A SICK PERSON CAN SEE.”

The project deals in the following sectors of the health department:
1. Calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) of customers based on the input data.
2. Classification into Fit, Overweight, or Underweight category.
3. Suggesting the appropriate and mindfully calculated diet chart as per the health concerns.
4. Dishing out a wellness routine for the customers on the basis of their requirements.
5. Recording their skin-related concerns and selling them the products that target the given issue.

### The Foot Forward: Algorithm Involved
1. Start
2. An inviting user interface is brought to display.
3. The user inputs their details (i.e., weight, height, age) in desired units.
4. The categorization is done as per the logical formula.

6. Bolstered with scientific backing, appropriate measures are displayed.
7. The user is asked to input their skin type and skin concerns.

2. Loops
3. Arithmetic operations
4. Logic building
5. Color coding
6. File handling
7. Arrays
8. Escape sequences

### Design of the Project:
The project is skillfully formulated to bring under its shadow some of the most crucial elements of our health and lifestyle. Every step of the program has its root embedded in scientific data and calculations, adding the much-needed dose of credibility to the design. The program begins with a welcome slide that introduces the user to the plethora of content lying underneath.  

As the program flows, the user is prompted to enter their required details to receive an outcome based on their body mass index (BMI).  

Now, the flow gets another route based on the problems faced by the user. While the overweight and underweight users are taken to their remedial ways, the one with normal figures is directed to another wellness sector that deals with mental health and skincare. The skincare department suggests the ingredients to be incorporated into their daily routine to overcome specific challenges that haunt their skin.
