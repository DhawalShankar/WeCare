THE SOURCE OF INSPIRATION:
With new gigantic buildings and skyscrapers giving
attendance every other day and robbing the natural world of
its authentic bliss , what has taken the backseat is our primary
mental and physical wellness.
We are lost in the vortex of our hectic life schedules to such a
deep and fatal extent that our health is left gasping for a
breath.
Keeping the demonic exacerbating health issues in limelight,
our project takes immense pride in flaunting and living by the
saying:
“ GOOD HEALTH IS A CROWN ON THE HEAD OF A WELL
PERSON THAT ONLY A SICK PERSON CAN SEE.”
THE PROJECT DEALS IN THE FOLLOWING SECTORS OF
HEALTH DEPARTMENT:
1. Calculating the Body Mass Index of customers based on
the input data.
2. Classification into Fit,Overweight or Underweight
category.
3. Suggesting the appropriate and mindfully calculated diet
chart as per the health concerns.

DESIGN OF THE PROJECT:<br>
The project is skillfully formulated to bring under its shadow
some of the most crucial elements of our health and
lifestyle.Every step of the program has its root embedded into
scientific data and calculations - adding the much needed
dose of credibility to the design.The program begins with a
welcome slide that introduces the user to the plethora of
content lying underneath.
As the program flows,the user is prompted to enter his/her
required details to receive an outcome based on his body mass
index (BMI).
Now,the flow gets another route based on the problems faced
by the user.While the overweight and underweight users are
taken to their remedial ways,the one with normal figures is
directed to another wellness sector that deals in mental health
and skincare.The skincare department suggests the
ingredients to be incorporated in daily routine to gain victory
over specific challenges that haunt our skin.<br>
